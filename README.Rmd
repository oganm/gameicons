This package adds a single function to use icons from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) in shiny applications or RMD files that are rendered to html. Most of these icons are licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). See the pages for the individual icons to see who you should credit. The font files are taken from [seiyria/gameicons-font](https://github.com/seiyria/gameicons-font/).

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github('oganm/gameicons')
```

## Usage

```r
game_icon('swordman')
```
![](man/figures/swordman.png)

```r
htmltools::html_print(shiny::actionButton('meh','Sword Dude',icon = game_icon('swordman')))
```
![](man/figures/sword_button.png)


You can list available icons, their authors and the license they were released under using `list_icons`.
